# Real-Time Optical Flow for Low- and High-Resolution Event Cameras

While currently empty, this repository will hold the code associated to the "Real-Time Optical Flow for Low- and High-Resolution Event Cameras" article once it has been accepted for publication.

## Overview

In this work, we propose an optimized framework for computing optical flow in real-time, with both low- and high-resolution event cameras, by computing dense image-like representations from the events through the use of our "inverse exponential distance surface".
